## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br />

The following example clones the "[Hello world](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CYW955513EVK-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW955513EVK-01 --app-id mtb-example-hal-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make modlibs` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br />

Following example adds the CYW955513EVK-01 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --add-bsp-name CYW955513EVK-01 --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyHelloWorld" --set-active-bsp CYW955513EVK-01
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br />

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and then import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

## Instructions
To demonstrate the app, follow these steps:

1. Build and download the application to the AIROC&#8482; board.
2. Open the ClientControl application
     - [UART] Open the "WICED HCI" port for the device. (Default baud rate configured in the application is defined by the BSP HCI\_UART\_DEAULT\_BAUD #define, usually either 3M or 115200 depending on the board UART capabilities.)
3. Use the ClientControl application to send various commands as mentioned below.
4. Run the BTSpy program to view protocol and application traces.

BR/EDR Audio Source and AVRC Target:

- The Watch app can demonstrate how to use BR/EDR Audio Source and AVRC TG profiles.
- Audio Source can use I2S interrupt or SW timer to decide the timing to read PCM.
  For media type as 'I2S input', it will use I2S interrupt, and you need to configure 4 GPIOs as AIROC&#8482; I2S PINs.
  For media type as 'Wav file' or 'Sine wave', it will use SW timer by calling wiced\_audio\_use\_sw\_timing(1).
  In general, if using the "WICED HCI" UART to transmit audio, it must either allocate I2S pins on unused pins for
  I2S interrupt OR use wiced\_audio\_use\_sw\_timing(1) to enable SW timer.
- Use the buttons in the ClientControl AV Source tab.
- To play a sine wave sample, set the audio frequency to the desired value (48kHz, 44.1kHz, etc.)
  and select the Media type as 'Sine Wave' in the UI. In this case, built-in sine wave audio is played.
- To play music from a .wav file, select the Media type as File, browse and select a .wav file,
  and set the audio frequency to the desired value (48kHz, 44.1kHz, etc.)
  In this case, audio for the .wav file is routed over the "WICED HCI" UART to the AIROC&#8482; board.<br>

sinc\_44100\_16\_L440\_R1000\_50s\_stereo.wav in the app folder can be used as the input of 44.1KHz 16bits stereo samples.
- To play music from a .mp3 file, select the Media type as File, browse and select a .mp3 file,
  and set the audio frequency to the desired value (48kHz, 44.1kHz, etc.)
  In this case, audio for the .mp3 file is routed over the "WICED HCI" UART to the AIROC&#8482; board.

## BTSTACK version

BTSDK AIROC&#8482; chips contain the embedded AIROC&#8482; Bluetooth&#174; stack, BTSTACK. Different chips use different versions of BTSTACK, so some assets may contain variant sets of files targeting the different versions in COMPONENT\_btstack\_vX (where X is the stack version). Applications automatically include the appropriate folder using the COMPONENTS make variable mechanism, and all BSPs declare which stack version should be used in the BSP .mk file, with a declaration such as:<br>
> COMPONENTS+=btstack\_v1<br>
or:<br>
> COMPONENTS+=btstack\_v3

## Common application settings

Application settings below are common for all BTSDK applications and can be configured via the makefile of the application or passed in via the command line.

##### BT\_DEVICE\_ADDRESS
> Set the BDA (Bluetooth&#174; Device Address) for your device. The address is 6 bytes, for example, 20819A10FFEE. By default, the SDK will set a BDA for your device by combining the 7 hex digit device ID with the last 5 hex digits of the host PC MAC address.

##### UART
> Set to the UART port you want to use to download the application. For example 'COM6' on Windows or '/dev/ttyWICED\_HCI\_UART0' on Linux or '/dev/tty.usbserial-000154' on macOS. By default, the SDK will auto-detect the port.

### Testing with PTS
1. While testing with PTS for certification test cases, please define ENABLE\_PTS\_TESTING flag in makefile as shown below.
   CY\_APP\_DEFINES += -DENABLE\_PTS\_TESTING

2. For A2DP/SNK/REL/BV/02-I test case, to initiate disconnection from IUT, please long press and hold the Vol- button

3. For A2DP/SNK/CC/BV-03-I and A2DP/SNK/CC/BV-04-I test cases, 16Khz and 32Khz sampling rate will be supported by defining ENABLE\_PTS\_TESTING flag

## BTSpy

BTSpy is a trace utility that can be used in the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; platforms to view protocol and generic trace messages from the embedded device. BTSpy is available as part of the ModusToolbox&trade; installation. If not, download and install [BTSpy](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-utils).

1. Add the `HCI_TRACE_OVER_TRANSPORT` macro in the Makefile or command-line `CY_APP_DEFINES+=HCI_TRACE_OVER_TRANSPORT`.

2. Call `wiced_hci_trace_enable();`

3. Ensure that retarget-io is not enabled on the same UART port as BTSpy. There is no need to initialize the retarget-io library if the application wants to send both application messages and Bluetooth&reg; protocol traces to the same port through BTSpy.

4. Use compiler directives to either initialize the retarget-io library or BTSpy logs depending on the debug macro setting.

   For example:
   ``` cpp
   #ifdef HCI_TRACE_OVER_TRANSPORT
   #define TRANS_UART_BUFFER_SIZE 1024
   #define TRANSPORT_BUFFER_SIZE 1500
   #define TRANSPORT_BUFFER_COUNT 2
   #define TRANSPORT_UART_BAUD_RATE 3000000
   typedef wiced_bool_t (*classic_audio_rpc_cback_t)(uint16_t opcode, uint8_t *p_data, uint32_t data_len);
   #endif
   ```

### Enable BTSpy logs

1. In the Makefile, set `CY_APP_DEFINES+=HCI_TRACE_OVER_TRANSPORT`.
2. Build and program the board.
3. Open ClientControl.
4. Set the baud rate to 3000000.
5. Deselect flow control.
6. Select the port and click **Open port**.
7. Launch BTSpy.
8. Press and release the reset button on the board to get BTSpy logs.
9. You should see all the application traces and the Bluetooth&reg; HCI messages. These messages help debug the HCI commands issued to the Bluetooth&reg; controller. Application traces indicate the start/stop of advertisements, connection/disconnection, and PHY updates.
